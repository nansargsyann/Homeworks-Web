            Yerevan
            The capital and the biggest city in Armenia is where you will most likely start your trip to Armenia.
            Even if Yerevan is older than Rome and recently celebrated its 2800th birthday you won’t find a classical old town with pretty buildings and charming corners. But Yerevan is such a fascinating place to visit!
            Yerevan is often called “the pink city” thanks to the volcanic tuff that was used when building the place – it gives a pinkish color to the buildings.
            The modern look of Yerevan was designed by Alexander Tumanyan at the beginning of the 20th century – he carefully planned the center of the city, with wide avenues, squares and green spaces. You can see it all still today.
            When visiting Yerevan you can’t miss the Republic Square (with the singing fountains), the Cascade complex and Tsitsernakaberd – the Armenian Genocide memorial complex.
            But the best things to do in Yerevan are to just wander around, visit a cafe or five and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of the city.
            Yerevan is one of my very favorite places ever and every time I visit Yerevan I fall for the city harder and harder. That’s why I’m here on my yet another Yerevan trip and that’s why I’m already thinking when I can visit Yerevan again.
